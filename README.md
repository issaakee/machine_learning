## Projects
Here are some of my notable projects:
- [Explanatory Data Analysis Pipeline Project](https://nbviewer.org/github/issaakee/machine_learning/blob/main/EDA.ipynb): For this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. Given my deep interest in football, I analyzed the dataset, covering necessary steps, including business context, data exploration, preprocessing, and a thorough EDA, followed by a discussion on the strengths and limitations of the analysis.
- [end-to-end Machine Learning Pipeline](https://nbviewer.org/github/issaakee/machine_learning/blob/main/Pipeline.ipynb): For this project, I developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using a publicly available car dataset from Kaggle. The pipeline covered data collection, preprocessing, exploration, feature engineering, model training, and assessment and concluded with insights drawn from the analysis.
